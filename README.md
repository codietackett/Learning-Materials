# Learning Materials

Just various items that I've found in my journey to become a Web Application Developer.

## Books

## Instructor Led Training/Learning

Sometimes learning can be difficult alone and having someone guide you will help a ton. Considering following someone else's lead may be the ideal approach for you. Here are some top suggestions at the moment.

- **Thinkful** (Coding Bootcamp): [thinkful.com](https://www.thinkful.com/)
- **Coding Dojo** (Coding Bootcamp): [codingdojo.com](https://www.codingdojo.com/)

## Self Paced Learning Tools

Learning is not a race and that's why I suggest making use of self-taught tools. It would be in your best interest to not stay secluded; however, keeping your mind fresh and solving problems will help develop more skill and confidence.
